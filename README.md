### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a web developer living and working in the Twin Cities, Minnesota. I've been working in IT on projects big and small for over a decade. I'm currently working on supplementing my developer knowledge with cyber security and dev ops concepts. In my free time I enjoy spending time with my family, the great outdoors and tinkering.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a Software Engineer on [Surgio](https://github.com/surgiollc), solutions to prevent Surgical Site Infections through digital governance of the sterilization processes
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning cybersecurity on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/arippberger336) and studying for my Security+ certificate
- âš¡ Fun fact: A piece of surfaced 2x4 lumber actually measures 1Â½ inches thick and 3Â½ inches wide.
